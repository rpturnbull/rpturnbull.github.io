## Biography
# Rory Turnbull, PhD CEng MIET  
**Research Fellow | [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/) in the [Healthcare Mechatronics Laboratory](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering-research-design-robotics-manufacturing/doc/robotics/page/2)**

I am a Research Fellow at the University of Leeds working in the Healthcare Mechatronics Laboratory. My background is in Medical and Biomedical Engineering, and my research focuses on developing wearable technologies that support better healthcare outcomes.

I completed a PhD investigating how people physically interact with wearable and assistive devices, with a particular focus on human–robot interaction. Since then, I have worked across a range of research and development projects, collaborating with clinicians, engineers, and industry partners. I have also spent time in medical device regulation consultancy, gaining practical experience in how healthcare technologies move from research into real-world use.

My current research focuses on wearable medical devices for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers. This work aims to better understand how pressure and shear forces act on the skin during everyday activities. By measuring these forces directly, the goal is to support earlier intervention and reduce the risk of serious complications for people living with diabetes.

Alongside my research, I am actively involved in research culture, engagement, and outreach activities. I contribute to initiatives that support researcher development, interdisciplinary collaboration, and public engagement with healthcare engineering. This website is both a personal research profile and a place to document and share these activities.

Iam also engaged in research and innovation that supports sustainable healthcare and the transition to net-zero medical technologies. This includes work aligned with the [NIHR Net Zero Innovation Catalyst](), where early-stage health technology development incorporates sustainability principles such as carbon literacy, circular design, and NHS Net Zero targets, helping ensure that future healthcare innovations are both clinically effective and environmentally responsible.
