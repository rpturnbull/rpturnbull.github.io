## Biography

My name is Rory Turnbull and I am a research fellow at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/) in the [Healthcare Mechatronics Laboratory](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering-research-design-robotics-optimisation/doc/healthcare-mechatronics). My background is in Medical and Biomedical Engineering with a PhD investigating physical human-robot interaction in wearable devices. Following my PhD I worked on a range of projects providing breadth to my research knowledge alongside some time in medical device regulation consultancy. 

My current research involves wearable medical device development for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcer formation through the assessment of dermal interaction pressure and shear.

Besides research I have been championing research culture and outreach work through a number of initiatives. I set up this website partially as a method of documenting these events.
