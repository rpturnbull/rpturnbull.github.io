University of Leeds Thesis Template meeting the requirements of the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Science. This template builds on the work by the Condensed Matter Physics Group Thesis [LaTeX Template](https://github.com/stonerlab/Thesis-template) which was originally posted 7 years ago. This was prior to the merging of faculties and so I have adjusted the template to meet the requirements of the Faculty of Engineering, now Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences.

Over time I included enough changes to warrant sharing my own version. Included are a number of helpful packages setting out figures as desired. Hopefully it is relatively easy to work with, some of the other templates I have seen were far more complicated than was necessary in my mind. Having shared the documents I will be working through and adding comments and example of each package that is used.
