SOCKSESS is an [EPSRC funded](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/X001059/1) research project investigating the development of "Smart Socks", capable of monitoring forces around the foot with the goal of preventing ulceration in diabetic patients. 

**NOTE**: Not to be confused with the [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/socksess/?hl=en) which highlights a selection of nice socks.

## But how do diabetic foot ulcers form?

Diabetic patients can be at higher risk of developing pressure ulcers due to nerve damage (neuropathy) that is instigated by prolonged periods of elevated blood sugar. The nerve damage means that the affected diabetic individuals are unable to perceive pain in those areas. In someone without neuropathy when pressure is applied too their skin, in this case the foot, for a prolonged period of time it causes discomfort. For example think about standing on the spot for a prolonged period or sitting in an uncomfortable seat for a prolonged period. You adjust how you are sitting to reduce the discomfort. The discomfort you experience is due to a reduction in blood flow and therefore oxygen to the region. In individuals experiencing neuropathy they are unable to feel that discomfort and so their body does not signal the need to change position. Prolonged exposure to this force can prevent blood flow and if it occurs for long enough the tissue can die. It is at this point that the pressure ulcer occurs. Pressure ulcers can lead to long period in hospital and in worst case situations infection and amputation of the foot.

## What are we trying to do?

While smart insoles currently exist, SockSESS has sets out to develop smart socks where sensing capabilities are embedded within the sock. Providing minimal change to the foots environment while enabling the device to slip seamlessly into patients every day life. I am working on the development of sensing technologies and their integration within the socks.

As the related work is disseminated publicly I will share more detailed information here.
