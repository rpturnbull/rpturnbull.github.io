caption: Smart socks for the prevention of diabetic pressure ulcers formation.
description: >
  Diabetic patients can be at higher risk of developing pressure ulcers due to neuropathy (nerve damage). Pressure ulcers can lead to long period in hospital and in worst case situations infection and amputation of the foot. While smart insoles currently exist, SockSESS has set out to develop smart socks where sensing capabilities are embedded within the sock. Providing minimal change to the foots environment.
