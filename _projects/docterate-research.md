Running from 2017 to 2022 with a slight disturbance by the COVID pandemic my PhD focused on human interaction in assistive exoskeleton. 

The work used SCONE combined with the High Fidelity Dynamic (HyFyDy) physics engine alongside the development of a passive physical lower limb system and human trials. Culminating in my thesis:

[Human-Robot Interaction in Passive Assistive Lower Limb Robotic Exoskeletons.](https://rpturnbull.github.io/publications/2022-08-24-thesis/)

~~~
Note: My thesis is currently under embargo until 2027 while I disseminate the work.
More information to follow as it becomes publicly available.
