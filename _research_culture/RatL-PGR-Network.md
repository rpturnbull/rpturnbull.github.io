In 2017 when I started my PhD at the University of Leeds it became clear there was a need for increased post graduate researcher (PGR) engagement. To instigate change, myself and like minded PGRs formed the the [*Robotics at Leeds PGR Network*](https://robotics.leeds.ac.uk/pgr-network/) as a forum to connect PGRs from across the different schools at the University of Leeds. The aim was to build an inter-school research culture through a common interest in robotics. Since then we have been involved in a range of events and outreach. My involvement with the postgradute research network is ongoing.


## A Pint of Robotics

![200x200](/assets/img/culture/RatL/Pint_of_Robotics.png "A Pint of Robotics"){:.lead width="200" height="200" }

An [ongoing](https://robotics.leeds.ac.uk/pgr-network/a-pint-of-robotics/) internal seminar series where researchers from across the Unviversity of Leeds with research interests in robotics have been invited to give talks. The aim of the event is to provide a platform for PhD students to practise presenting their work while informing others of the great research being undertaken across Leeds. Research topics have included:
 <ul>
  <li>Magnetic manipulators for surginal robotics</li>
  <li>Vision based object manipulation</li>
  <li>The ethics of sex robots</li>
  <li>Pipe inspection robots</li>
</ul>

## Internal Conferences
In 2018 and 2019 we hosted internal Robotics at Leeds conferences to provide post-graduate researchers with a platform to present their work. Each day event was attended by over 80 participants. The event stopped due to the pandemic though will likely return.

## Outreach

In may 2023 I had the opportunity to represent [Robotics at Leeds at ICRA 2023](https://rpturnbull.github.io/outreach/20230501-icra-2023/). It was a great experiance and I look forward to acting on the connections made.

[Be Curious 2019.](https://rpturnbull.github.io/outreach/2019-03-30-Be-Curious/) An [outreach event](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/becurious) held in the Parkinson building at the University of Leeds each year. The focus of this event is engaging with the general public witht the goal of inspiring the next generation of STEM researchers, scientists and engineers.

During their week of science in 2018 the [PGR network attended](https://rpturnbull.github.io/outreach/2018-03-06-UTC-Robotics-Week) the Unviersity Technical Colleage in Leeds giving a number of talks and running a workshop based around the lego mindstorm systems. Through the workshop we hoped to encourage problem solving while introducing the students to basic electronics and coding concepts.

## Industry Engagement

We are currently looking to engage more with local industry. Originally connected with at ICRA 2023 [*BOW*](https://bow.software/login) are a spin out company based in Sheffield. Their purpose is to produce a platform capable of providing a common programming interface for multiple robotics system. Given the potential applications at the Univerity of Leeds we organised a talk and visit from their CEO Daniel Camiller.

## Proffessional Body Engagement
A more recent activity is engaging with proffessional bodies to support postgraduate researchers and postdoctroal researchers pursue chartership with their respective industry body ([IMechE](www.imeche.org) or [IET](https://www.theiet.org/)).
