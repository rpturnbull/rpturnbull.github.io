<h3> Abstract </h3>
<blockquote>
Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) are a significant health and economic burden, potentially leading to limb amputation, with a severe impact on a person’s quality of life. During active movements like gait, the monitoring of shear has been suggested as an important factor for effective prevention of DFUs. It is proposed that, in textiles, strain can be measured as a proxy for shear stress at the skin. This paper presents the conceptualisation and development of a novel strain-sensing approach that can be unobtrusively integrated within sock textiles and worn within the shoe. Working with close clinical and patient engagement, a sensor specification was identified, and 12 load-sensing approaches for the prevention of DFU were evaluated. A lead concept using a conductive adhesive was selected for further development. The method was developed using a Lycra sample, before being translated onto a knitted ‘sock’ substrate. The resultant strain sensor can be integrated within mass-produced textiles fabricated using industrial knitting machines. A case-study was used to demonstrate a proof-of-concept version of the strain sensor, which changes resistance with applied mechanical strain. A range of static and dynamic laboratory testing was used to assess the sensor’s performance, which demonstrated a resolution of 0.013 Ω across a range of 0–430 Ω and a range of interest of 0–20 Ω. In cyclic testing, the sensor exhibited a cyclic strain threshold of 6% and a sensitivity gradient of 0.3 ± 0.02, with a low dynamic drift of 0.039 to 0.045% of the total range. Overall, this work demonstrates a viable textile-based strain sensor capable of integration within worn knitted structures. It provides a promising first step towards developing a sock-based strain sensor for the prevention of DFU formation.
