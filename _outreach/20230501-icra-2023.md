# ICRA 2023

ICRA 2023 was in London so given its proximity to Leeds myself and other University of Leeds members volunteered to run the Robotics @ Leeds stall in the exhibition centre.

On the stall we had representatives from 

- [Healthcare Mechatronics.](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/mechanical-engineering-research-design-robotics-optimisation/doc/healthcare-mechatronics) Demonstrating a range of mechatronic healthcare technologies.
- [Real Robotics.](https://www.realrobotics.co.uk/) Demonstrating field robotics
- [Robotics Laboratory.](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/743/dr-mehmet-dogar) Demonstrating computer vision informed manipulation
- [Cities, Infrastructure & Energy.](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/cities-infrastructure-energy) Demonstrating the automation of shell structure construction.
- [STORM Lab UK.](https://www.stormlabuk.com/about-us/) Located across from the Robotics at Leeds stall as part of the kuka exhibition. Highlighting their magnetic surgical robotics set up that recently span out into company name

Over the course of 4 days we spoke to hundreds of attendees. Made new contacts who we hope will be visiting the University of Leeds.

Highlights for myself included the opportunity to see one of my inspirations /role models Hugh Herr from the MIT media lab. He is one of the reasons I got into research in the first place as one of the inspirations for my interest in human interfacing robots.

Additionally seeing the head of Boston Dynamics *name* give a talk about their design processes. Resonated with me as it normalises failure. The faster you can fail the faster you can improve. Distilled down to the following. 
 <ul>
  <li>Make it</li>
  <li>Brake it</li>
  <li>Fix it</li>
</ul>
