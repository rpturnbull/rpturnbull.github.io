In 2017 when I started my PhD at the University of Leeds it became clear there was a need for increased post graduate researcher (PGR)  engagement. To instigate change, myself and like minded PGRs formed the the *Robotics at Leeds PGR Network* as a forum to connect PGRs from across the different schools at the University of Leeds. The aim was to build an inter-school research culture through a common interest in robotics. Since then we have been involved in a range of events and outreach.
