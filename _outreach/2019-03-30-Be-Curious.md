The [PGR network](https://rpturnbull.github.io/research-culture/RatL-PGR-Network/) team showcased the robot Baxter in a stand called "Baxter’s sweet shop" and Turtlebots, from the school of Computing.

Baxter‘s sweet shop consisted in an interactive activity with children. Once potential customers were detected, they were given the opportunity to order a number of red and blue sweets using an app on a Tablet. Then, Baxter was picking the desired sweets and put them in a bag. Children were finally offered real sweets.

The Turtlebots were moved around a demonstration area, sometimes bumping into people and offering them  sweets as a form of interaction. The event was a success with over 1,200 participants across all age ranges.
