In 2016 I was selected to become part of the founding committee for the student arm of the Healthcare Technology Cooperative foundation (HTCf) at the University of Leeds.

Pioneering work to create a multi-disciplinary environment within the student body at Leeds. To encourage innovation by identifying clinical problems and solving these through a collaboration of students from various schools within the university.
 
We instigated talks, seminars and workshops looking to identify an unmet clinical need in colorectal therapy due to links with the NIHR (!?! Acronym) in Colorectal Therapies based in the University of Leeds teaching hospital.

Over the two years I was involved we had 70 students involved. The HTCf later merged with the [MedTech Foundation](https://www.medtechfoundation.org/) and has now successfully run for 7 years (Written in 2023).
